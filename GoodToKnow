Multiline comments don't actually exist in Python-

As part of the Python course it is taught that in order to do a multiline comment one should use """triple quotes""".
This is wrong. Python only has one way of doing comments and that is using #.
Triple quotes are treated as regular strings with the exception that they can span multiple lines. 
By regular strings I mean that if they are not assigned to a variable they will be immediately garbage collected as soon as that code executes.
hence are not ignored by the interpreter in the same way that #a comment is.
